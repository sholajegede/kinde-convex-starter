# Users and Authentication Example App
This example demonstrates how to add users and authentication to a basic file sharing application. It uses [Kinde](https://kinde.com) for authentication.

Users are initially presented with **Get started** and **Log in** buttons. After user's sign up, their information is sent through a webhook and persisted to a `users` table on Convex. Users can also sign up and log in with passwordless authentication, social logins and have access to role-based access control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Node.js installed on your computer.
- Familiarity with TypeScript, React, and Next.js.
- Free accounts on [Kinde](https://kinde.com) and [Convex](https://www.convex.dev).

## üîß Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sholajegede/kinde-convex-starter.git
cd kinde-convex-starter
```
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
bun install
```
3. Run the Development Server
```bash

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up your own Kinde instance
Follow the instructions in [https://docs.convex.dev/auth/kinde#get-started](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/kinde#get-started) to obtain your **Kinde** and **Convex** credentials.

Update the `.env.local` file with your obtained credentials:
